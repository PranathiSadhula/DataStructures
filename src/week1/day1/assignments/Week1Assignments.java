 * Arrays and String Problem
1.	283. Move Zeroes
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/move-zeroes/
Problem Statement:
Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.
Example 1:
Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
Example 2:
Input: nums = [0]
Output: [0]


2.	485. Max Consecutive Ones
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/max-consecutive-ones/
Problem Statement:
Given a binary array nums, return the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array.
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,1,0,1,1,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: The first two digits or the last three digits are consecutive 1s. The maximum number of consecutive 1s is 3.
Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,0,1,1,0,1]
Output: 2





3.	169. Majority Element
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/
Problem Statement:
Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.
The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.
Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,2,3]
Output: 3
Example 2:
Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
Output: 2

4.	977. Squares of a Sorted Array
Link:  https://leetcode.com/problems/squares-of-a-sorted-array/

Problem Statement:
Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, return an array of the squares of each number sorted in non-decreasing order.
 Example 1:
Input: nums = [-4,-1,0,3,10]
Output: [0,1,9,16,100]
Explanation: After squaring, the array becomes [16,1,0,9,100].
After sorting, it becomes [0,1,9,16,100].
Example 2:
Input: nums = [-7,-3,2,3,11]
Output: [4,9,9,49,121]



5.	345. Reverse Vowels of a String
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-vowels-of-a-string/
Problem Statement:
Given a string s, reverse only all the vowels in the string and return it.The vowels are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u', and they can appear in both cases.
Example 1:
Input: s = "hello"
Output: "holle"
Example 2:
Input: s = "leetcode"
Output: "leotcede

6.	392. Is Subsequence
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence/
Problem Statement:
Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.
A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).
Example 1:
Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true
Example 2:
Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false
